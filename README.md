# jsdoc-duck
jsdoc-duck is a minimalist library that helps organize mid-complex state handling with type-guarded dispatch-capable actions. It leverages `useReducer` and jsDoc/Javascript to bring type safety and structure to your application's state management.
It is based on [react-state-factory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-state-factory)

## Installation

```sh
npm add jsdoc-duck
# or yarn
yarn add jsdoc-duck
# or pnpm
pnpm add jsdoc-duck
```

## jsDoc cannot able to serve module for types 
I faced a lot of problem when try create a proper npm/js module with jsdoc declared types,
which is mandatory step to release this module.
So the hype which is talking about jsDoc is so proper replacer of typescript is not 100% sure.
